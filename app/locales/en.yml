    desc: '
      As far as standards and protocols are concerned, the story of

      the Internet is one of free software. But its popularity and potential make big firms jealous.

      They would like to claim control of it by establishing closed code in locked systems

      that are not interoperable.

      To keep the Internet faithful to the founding principles which led to its success,

      it is important that there should be free apps on the Internet, that is to say,

      apps with opensource codes, accessible under free licence.

  ethic:
    title: Ethics
    desc: '
      We wish to support a participative and

      independent Internet. Exploitation, surveillance, censorship, and data

      appropriation are trends we refuse in favor of transparency (integrity),

      clearly displayed policies for users of the various services, and the refusal of all forms of discrimination.

      The genius of the Internet must dwell at the margins of the network

      in a peer-to-peer sharing dynamic, to avoid creating a Minitel 2.0. To insure equality

      for all concerned, from citizens to businesses, monopolies must not only be excluded, but also

      prevented from monopolizing personal or public data. Through clear

      tutorials explaining how to propagate free solutions for establishing a fairer Internet,

      we intend to facilitate the spreading of codes and a diversification of usages.

      Through the services we provide, we promote a model

      based on cost participation, resource sharing, and accessibility

      for the largest number of people.

      Any abuse will thus be avoided, for we all remain fully aware of our common interests.

      This model also has an educational purpose since, as we document the roll-out of services,

      many users will in their turn be able to share those resources.

      Engulfed in sprawling multinational firms, a few non-profit organizations keep up the struggle for an

      open web respectful of internet users.

      In addition to @:msg.meta.F, the non-profit association

    text1: '
      Online services are often

      closed-source: once you start using them, it is very difficult

      to leave, because these companies do everything to keep you captive by

      preventing you, for example, from migrating your data elsewhere.
      '
    text2: '
      Using open source services means making sure that you will never be controlled by a particular website,

      but also that you can always migrate your data elsewhere.
      '
  centralisum:
    title: <i lang="la">Centralizum</i>
    text1: '
      Centralized services raise many problems: they make your data very vulnerable (one inaccessible website

      and everything is down) and make it very easy for third parties to exploit your data.
      '
    text2: '
      Using decentralized online services means maintaining a choice between using an online resource such as

      those proposed by Framasoft or installing/managing the service yourself.
      '
  espionnum:

    text1: '
      “If it’s free, you are the product”: many online services make a living by exploiting your personal data,

      i.e., selling it to advertising companies. Furthermore, most of these services are based in the United

      States and obey US laws like the PATRIOT ACT which deny all rights to privacy.
      '
    text2: '
      Using online services hosted in Europe means ensuring that you are not dependent on the laws of another

      continent. In addition, by hosting the service yourself, no third party can violate your privacy.
      '

      Freedom-depriving services ("proprietary" in everyday language) are totally opaque: it is impossible to

      know exactly what the software does with your data. Only the publisher has control over it.

      Using Free online services means being sure the community has control over the software and maintains the

      ability to modify it, to install it elsewhere, etc.

        In recent years, we have witnessed <strong> the widespread corporate concentration

        of Internet actors</strong>  (Youtube belonging to Google,

        WhatsApp to Facebook, Skype to Microsoft, etc.).

        This centralisation is detrimental, not only because it

        curbs innovation, but also because it results in a

        loss of freedom for users,

        <strong>who no longer control their digital existence</strong>:

        their behaviour is continually dissected and analysed so that they can be better targeted by

        publicity, and their data – which should be private (sites visited,

        emails exchanged, videos watched, etc.) – can be analysed

        by government services.

          This information can be used to display targeted adverts,

          but the revelations of the Snowden case have also shown

          this data (sometimes extremely private: emails from Gmail,

          Major actors of the Internet have become real

          giants: Facebook has acquired WhatsApp and Instagram, Google owns

          Youtube and Waze, Microsoft distributes Skype, etc.<br/>

          This concentration of actors creates multiple issues:

          what if Facebook were suddenly shut down?

          And how could we browse the Web if Google went down?

          <strong>We rely more and more on services provided

          it’s hard to launch a startup that can match up to Apple or Google

          (the first and second worldwide market capitalisations, respectively).<br/>

          Finally, The lack of diversity of the giants means

          they can track many people who are unaware that there may be alternatives,

          and it can influence the kind of data you receive
